# MindStorm-mobile

## How to run app
- `cd mindstorm-app` 
- run `npx expo start`
## Sprint 2

Sonya: I primarily worked on the front-end and back-end (not including server/data storage) voice assistant functionality within the mobile app (all commits in old repo, just pushed final voice assistant from old repo). Experimented with Flutter. Worked on prompting with OpenAI and creating a custom GPT that can analyze journal entries/stressful thoughts and make actionable checklists. Validated custom GPT ability to adapt to user preferences when giving advice and suggestions for coping mechanisms. Also got user validation from TikTok.


## Sprint 3
Sonya: I plan on helping out with the front-end, the GPT prompting, as well as data storage. My focus will be on trying to make the GPT produce the intended output and implementing trigger safeguards for sensitive information such as trauma. I will work on creating different custom GPTs for the respective "buddies" in the app for each need.
